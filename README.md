Lab-01:Git, GitHub and, Terminal

## Introduction
Hello! my name is Noor Zyoud and this is my first assignment!

## What I learned from today's lecture
In today's lecture we have tackled important topics like:

* ***Terminal***
* ***Git***
* ***GitHub*** 

We understood the Key differences between **GUI** and **CLI**
mainly how GUI lets a user interact with the device/system with the help of graphical elements. The CLI, on the other hand, lets a user interact with their device/system with the help of various commands. 

We were also introduced to amazing resources that will aid us in our studies like:
1. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
2. [Git Commands Cheat Sheet](https://www.plesk.com/blog/various/git-commands-cheat-sheet/)
3. [good-developer-mindset](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/)
